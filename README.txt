This is my first programming project in Python. This simple using OCR technologies app is used for controlling your monthly expenses. 
User after click the "dodaj pragon" button is asked for upload a photo of his recent receipt. It's very important to have a photo in good quality.

To run this code you need this libraries: PyQt5, numpy, datatime, pytesseract, os, cv2, tkinter, pyqtgraph and sys.
